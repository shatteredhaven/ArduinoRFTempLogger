Google Spreadsheet Readme

This python script is based on the Adafruit DHT Humidity Sensing on Raspberry Pi with GDocs Logging (http://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/overview).

There are a few requirements before you can begin logging the arduino data to google docs:
1) create a spreadsheet on google drive
2) delete rows 2-100 on the spreadsheet 
3) update the python script with your user name, password, and the spreadsheet name
4) run!

For more information please see the Adafruit tutorial for more information.
